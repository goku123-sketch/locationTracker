# locationTracker

Location Tracker website is build using Leaflet.js , it is a sub-part of my big contech startup Project in which an indivdual can track the work currently going on a particular location.
The left part is a slider through which a person can slide to search their location when clicked on a particular location map navigate itself using zoom-in and zoom out technology and points to that particular location on maps.


Leaflet.js is generally used for locating particular points of a particular location on map.
